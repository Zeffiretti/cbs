	abstract = {Abstract We review the use of clay models to explore questions about predation rates on small vertebrate taxa that are typically difficult to observe directly. The use of models has a relatively long history and we examine the range of taxa studied, which includes squamate reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds. Within this review, we have also included studies of model eggs, which are used in nest predation studies. We review the questions that have been asked and the interpretations arising from the data. The use of clay model animals has provided us with insights into how differences in prey morphology, size, and colour influence the rate at which they are attacked by predators. This allows us insights into the ecological, behavioural and evolutionary selective pressures of different predators on small vertebrate prey, including analysis of what characteristics predators target and how predators approach their prey (e.g. which part of the body is attacked). Further available interpretations include how regional and habitat variation influences predation events on models. We also briefly discuss the potential for clay models to study interspecific sociality and competition. Finally, we review the problems and limitations with the method and make some suggestions for further studies and amendments to help standardize this creative tool for ecological research.},

With numerous successful applications in business intelligence, health care, finance, and gaming, the RL framework is ideal for sequential decision-making in unknown environments with large amounts of data. Multiarmed bandits are the simplest form of reinforcement learning. This chapter provides a systematic bridge between RL and multiarmed bandits. We also discuss the state-of-the-art results in nonstationary environment, which is practical in several real-life applications.}

ABSTRACT = {This article surveys reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. Reinforcement learning is a framework for decision-making problems in which an agent interacts through trial-and-error with its environment to discover an optimal behavior. Since interaction is a key component in both reinforcement learning and social robotics, it can be a well-suited approach for real-world interactions with physically embodied social robots. The scope of the paper is focused particularly on studies that include social physical robots and real-world human-robot interactions with users. We present a thorough analysis of reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. In addition to a survey, we categorize existent reinforcement learning approaches based on the used method and the design of the reward mechanisms. Moreover, since communication capability is a prominent feature of social robots, we discuss and group the papers based on the communication medium used for reward formulation. Considering the importance of designing the reward function, we also provide a categorization of the papers based on the nature of the reward. This categorization includes three major themes: interactive reinforcement learning, intrinsically motivated methods, and task performance-driven methods. The benefits and challenges of reinforcement learning in social robotics, evaluation methods of the papers regarding whether or not they use subjective and algorithmic measures, a discussion in the view of real-world reinforcement learning challenges and proposed solutions, the points that remain to be explored, including the approaches that have thus far received less attention is also given in the paper. Thus, this paper aims to become a starting point for researchers interested in using and applying reinforcement learning methods in this particular research field.},

  abstract  = {Markov decision processes (mdps) model decision making in discrete, stochastic, sequential environments. The essence of the model is that a decision maker, or agent, inhabits an environment, which changes state randomly in response to action choices made by the decision maker. The state of the environment affects the immediate reward obtained by the agent, as well as the probabilities of future state transitions. The agent's objective is to select actions to maximize a long-term measure of total reward. Efficient algorithms for mdps based on dynamic programming and linear programming, and more recently on compact representations, enable large planning problems from artificial intelligence, operations research, economics, robotics, and the behavioral sciences to be modeled and solved.}

  abstract = { The brain's function is to enable adaptive behavior in the world. To this end, the brain processes information about the world. The concept of representation links the information processed by the brain back to the world and enables us to understand what the brain does at a functional level. The appeal of making the connection between brain activity and what it represents has been irresistible to neuroscience, despite the fact that representational interpretations pose several challenges: We must define which aspects of brain activity matter, how the code works, and how it supports computations that contribute to adaptive behavior. It has been suggested that we might drop representational language altogether and seek to understand the brain, more simply, as a dynamical system. In this review, we argue that the concept of representation provides a useful link between dynamics and computational function and ask which aspects of brain activity should be analyzed to achieve a representational understanding. We peel the onion of brain representations in search of the layers (the aspects of brain activity) that matter to computation. The article provides an introduction to the motivation and mathematics of representational models, a critical discussion of their assumptions and limitations, and a preview of future directions in this area. }

ABSTRACT={A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.}
