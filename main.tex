%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
% In the existing robot-rat interaction, robots usually exert influence as stimuli
% to observe the response of target rats. However, the above single-stimulation
% model from robot to rat lacks a two-way communication. Therefore, we proposed a
% method to learn the rat-like behavioral interaction. First, we constructed two
% behavior patterns in the interaction process between the two rats: the
% individual pattern and the interaction pattern. We divided the roles of the two
% rats into active stimulator and passive receiver. The stimulator executes the
% individual pattern, and the receiver switches between the two patterns. Which
% pattern the receiver executes depends on the probability of interaction.
% Secondly, we proposed a hypothesis concerning the behavioral interaction between
% two rats and controlled the interaction process between two robots. Information
% entropy was used to measure the similarity between two robots and two rats. The
% results proved that the probability of interaction between rats depends on the
% distance of centroid and average relative velocity, and we obtained the optimal
% solution to express the relationship between them. In the future, the
% improvement of robots' interaction ability with rats will highly benefit from
% this study.

In this paper, we propose a finite state decision strategy using reinforcement
learning for a robotic rat to interact with animals in a more natural manner. In
previous study, we proved that the finite states of the interaction of rats can
be divided into eight movements and six types of behavior. To find the optimal
strategy of a robotic rat to interact with animals among these states, we use
Monte-Carlo method to optimize the finite state decision process. First, we
evaluate the similarity of the behavior between the robotic rat and the animals
through the objective function of the motion description variables in robot
configuration space. Second, we make different states sampling to generate robot
motions in a simulation environment which includes two robotic rats. To ensure
that the behavior similarity is no less than 0.6 in any situations,
Broyden-Fletcher-Glodfrab-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is adopted to find the optimal
finite state decision strategy.
The results show that \textcolor{red}{...}
% optimize the sampling using Broyden-Fletcher-Glodfrab-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm.

% \subsection*{Citations}
% % Citations of references in the text should be identified using numbers in
% square brackets e.g., ``as discussed by Cui \cite{Cui1}'' or ``as discussed
% elsewhere \cite{Cui1,Ninomiya1,Li1,Wang1,Yang1}.'' All references should be
% cited within the text and uncited references will be removed.

% As an example, this template includes a ``sample.bib'' file containing the references in BibTeX.

% %%%%%% Equations %%%%%%
% \subsection*{Equations}
% Equations should be provided in a text format, rather than as an image.
% Equations should be numbered consecutively, in round brackets, on the
% right-hand side of the page by using the ``\textbackslash begin\{equation\}''
% command. They should be referred to as Equation 1, etc. in the main text.

% \medskip For example, see Equation \ref{eq:1} and Equation \ref{eq:2} below.
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
%     a^2 + b^2 = c^2
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
% \begin{split}
% A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
%  & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}

% %%%%%% Figures %%%%%%
% \subsection*{Figures}
% Figures should be called out within the text and numbered in the order of
% their citation in the text. Every figure must have a descriptive title
% beginning with ``Figure [Number] …'' All figure titles should be either a
% phrase or a sentence; do not mix the two styles. See Figure \ref{fig:1} for
% example.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig 1}
%     \caption{This is an example figure.}
%     \label{fig:1}
% \end{figure}

% Figures should be displayed on a white background. When preparing figures,
% consider that they can occupy either a single column (half page width) or two
% columns (full page width), and should be sized accordingly.

% If a figure consists of multiple panels, they should be ordered logically and
% labelled with lower case roman letters (i.e., a, b, c, etc.). All labels
% should be explained in the legend. See Figure \ref{fig:2} for example.

% Upon acceptance, authors will be asked to provide the figures as separate
% electronic files. At that stage, figures should be supplied in either vector
% art formats (PS, EPS, FIG, AI, Visio, WMF, EMF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OPJ,
% CDR, or PDF) or bitmap formats (Photoshop, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
% Bitmap (BMP) images should be of at least 300 dpi resolution, unless due to
% the limited resolution of a scientific instrument. If a bitmap image has
% labels, the image and labels should be embedded in separate layers.
% \begin{figure}[h]

%     \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
%         \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height=2in]{fig 1}

%     (\subref{fig:2a}) This is the first panel. (\subref{fig:2b}) This is the
%     second panel.}

% %%%%%% Tables %%%%%%
% \subsection*{Tables}
% Tables should supplement, not duplicate, the text. They should be called out
% consecutively within the text and numbered in the order of their citation in
% the text.

% Every table must have a descriptive title beginning with ``Table [Number] …''
% as noted in Table \ref{tab:1}. If numerical measurements are given, the units
% should be included in the column heading. Every vertical column should have a
% heading, followed by a unit of measure (if any) in parentheses. Units should
% not change within a column. Vertical rules should not be used.

% Centered headings of the body of the table can be used to break the entries
% into groups. Do not use footnotes in column heads; include any such details in
% sentence form in the table legend. Footnotes should contain information
% relevant to specific cells of the table; use the following symbols in order,
% as needed: $*, \dag, \ddag, \S, \|, \P, \#, **, \dag\dag$, etc.

% \begin{table}[b]
%     \caption{This is an example table.}

% \section{Materials and Methods}
% The materials and methods section should provide sufficient information to
% allow replication of the results. This section should be broken up by
% subheadings. Under exceptional circumstances, when a particularly lengthy
% description is required, a portion of the materials and methods can be
% included in the Supplementary Materials.

% \subsection{Experimental Design}
% Begin with a section titled Experimental Design describing the objectives and
% design of the study as well as prespecified components.

% \subsection{Statistical Analysis}
% If applicable, include a section titled Statistical Analysis that fully
% describes the statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable
% reader with access to the original data to verify the results. The values for
% N, P, and the specific statistical test performed for each experiment should
% be included in the appropriate figure legend or main text.

% For investigations on humans, a statement must be including indicating that
% informed consent was obtained after the nature and possible consequences of
% the study was explained.

% For authors using experimental animals, a statement must be included
% indicating that the animals’ care was in accordance with institutional
% guidelines.

% \section{Results}
% The results should describe the experiments performed and the findings
% observed. The results section should be divided into subsections to delineate
% different experimental themes.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item All data should be presented in the Results. No data should be
%     presented for the first time in the Discussion. Data (such as from Western
%     blots) should be appropriately quantified.
%     \item Subheadings must be either all complete sentences or all phrases.
%     They should be brief, ideally less than 10 words. Subheadings should not
%     end in a period. Your paper may have as many subheadings as are necessary.
%     \item Figures and tables must be called out in numerical order. For
%     example, the first mention of any panel of Fig. 3 cannot precede the first
%     mention of all panels of Fig. 2. The supplementary figures (for example,
%     fig. S1) and tables (table S1) must also be called out in numerical order.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Discussion}
% Include a Discussion that summarizes (but does not merely repeat) your
% conclusions and elaborates on their implications. There should be a paragraph
% outlining the limitations of your results and interpretation, as well as a
% discussion of the steps that need to be taken for the findings to be applied.
% Please avoid claims of priority.
